  It has all begun with Charles Darwin suggesting that due to the struggle to survive, animals adapt to their environment. The fittest would be rewarded by passing their genes to the next generation subject to the laws of Natural Selection. One of the most magnificent minds of his was that animals change according to their geographical distributions. From that moment it is all history.

  The picture above was once thought to contain different species until it was found out that they were all diverged from the same species. Those are the adapted offsprings of the ancestors which were fittest thanks to natural selection and the law of variation.

  This project reviews different aspects by which the process of evolution occurrs. It is based on 40 years study of
  <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691160467/40-years-of-evolution"> Grant & Grant</a>, models describing competition, migration, and enviromental changes and more thoughts about the fundamental process.
